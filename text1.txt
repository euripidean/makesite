On Jubilee Street
There was a girl named Bee
She had a history
But she had no past
When they shut her down
The Russians moved in
I’m too scared, I’m too scared
To even walk on past
She used to say
All those good people
Down on Jubilee Street
They ought to practice what they preach
Those good people
On Jubilee Street
And here I come up the hill
I’m pushing my wheel of love
I got love in my tummy
And a tiny little pain
And a ten ton catastrophe
On a sixty pound chain
And I’m pushing
My wheel of love up Jubilee Street
Oh look at me now
The problem was
She had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Well a girl’s got to make ends meet
Even down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time
And over the hill
And out of my mind
On Jubilee Street
I ought to practice what I preach
These days I go down town
In my tie and tails
I got a foetus on a leash
I am alone now
I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut
The furniture has gone
I am transforming
I am vibrating
I am glowing
I am flying
Look at me now
